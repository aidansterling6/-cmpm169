			<h1>Experiment 6: Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I decided to Imitate this text effect:</p>
				<img class="cat-photo" height="600px" src="img/Img1.PNG">
				<br>
				<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_2_5_02">http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_3_2_5_02</a>
				<br>
				<p>Here is my version:</p>
				<iframe src="Imitation/index.html" height="820" width="815" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
				<br>

				<p>I decided to just generally imitate it and not copy it exactly. One of the reasons I did this was because I wanted to use the text function rather than use my own font like the example does. I manually drew lines down the center of the characters using a tool I made. I also made a line function that had the moving dot effect on it. I then could simply combine these to get the final effect.</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I decided to integrate this into a grid like this example:</p>
				<img class="cat-photo" height="600px" src="img/Img2.PNG">
				<br>
				<a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_1_4_01">http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?01_P/P_2_1_4_01</a>
				<p>Here is my version:</p>
				<iframe src="Integration/index.html" height="820" width="815" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
				<br>
				<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/coco558/sketches/5eCzvuLF6">https://editor.p5js.org/coco558/sketches/5eCzvuLF6</a>
				<p>For the integration I added the ability to make multiple characters have the effect. I could make the effect happen with pretty much any text I wanted as long as I set it up first. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>For innovation, I made the letters link up at their ends to create a network of lines:</p>
				<iframe src="Innovation/index.html" height="820" width="815" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
				<br>
				<a href="https://editor.p5js.org/coco558/sketches/urgBDym8m">https://editor.p5js.org/coco558/sketches/urgBDym8m</a>
				<p>I used the already made lines from the letters to find connection points between letters. I choose a rondom point to connect a new letter to and then add it. I add a bunch of letters each frame and I slowly fade old letters using the background.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section"> 
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I did not get as far as I wanted to in this experiment because I was overloaded with work from other classes. I wanded to make new letters only spawn when they dont collide with already created letters. I wrote code to do this but I didnt have time to ignore collistions with the point a new letter is spawned from. I could probably do this if I had more time. I hope that I can revisit this project later when I have more time.</p>
